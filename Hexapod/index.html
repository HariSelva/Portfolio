              One of the courses that I most enjoyed during my time at UWaterloo was MTE 544 - Autonomous Mobile Robots. It inspired 
              me to want to build my own mobile robot. Learning more about robotics, ROS, and autonomous navigation is one of the 
              reasons behind this project. In order to do this, I would need a vehicular platform, through which this learning can be 
              done. As well, taking into account, my other interests such as nerf blasters, it would also be interesting to have a 
              mobile nerf turret. As such, this project would need to be a multi-terrain robotic platfrom, on which future projects, 
              whether they be a nerf turret, or an autonomous mobile robot can be built upon.

      <!-- SECTION 2: Design Parameters -->

        <div class="w-100">
          <h2 class="mb-4 timeline-left-heading">Design Parameters</h2>
          <div class="container">
            There were a few design parameters that were set for this project. In no particular order, these are as follows:
            <ul>
              <li>Needs to inherently stable (i.e. it should be able to balance without additional hardware or software)</li>
              <li>Should have at least 3 degrees of freedom to allow for versatility in future projects</li>
              <li>Should be multi-terrain</li>
              <li>Stay within a budget of $400</li>
              <li>Needs to have a platform/area on which additional hardware (i.e. LIDAR, Nerf Turret, Robotic Arm, etc.) can be mounted</li>
              <li>System should be able to support its own weight as well as have capacity for additional hardware</li>
              <li>Parts should be either 3D printed or off the shelf</li>
           </ul>

           The first four parameters defined the type of robot for this project, while the rest ensured it would be successful. Based 
           on these parameters, a decision matrix was created to decide what type of robot would best fit this project. This is shown 
           below:

           <br>
           <img src="./media/Decision Matrix.png" style="width: 75%; height: 75%;" class="center">
           <br>

           In terms of cost, the deciding factor was the number of motors required for each type of robot. The various motors required 
           range from 12-20 dollars each, which I've considered to be about the same price range. As such the more motors, the more costly. The tank 
           costs the least with only two motors. In second is the holonomic vehicle with 3 motors in a kiwi drive configuration. Then 
           the aerial drone with 4 motors in a quadcopter configuration and the hexapod in last due to each leg requiring 3 motors for 
           a total of 18 motors minimum.

           <br><br>

           Concerning the robot being multi-terrain, the aerial drone is the best as it can just fly over any terrain, followed by the 
           legged robot, due to its great maneuverability. Then comes the tank due to the tank treads allow for it to traverse a wider
           variety of terrain. Lastly is the holonomic robot as it would only be able function on smooth flat surfaces.

           <br><br>

           Regarding degrees of freedom, the aerial drone and the hexapod both have 6 degrees of freedom and are thus the best options. 
           The holonomic vehicle has 3 degrees of freedom putting it in third, with the tank taking last place with only 2 degrees of 
           freedom.

           <br><br>

           In terms of stability/balance, both the holonomic vehicle and the tank are the best as their configuration means they are 
           unlikely to tip over or require extra hardware/software to prevent them from tipping over. The hexapod come in third, due 
           to its tripod gait which grants it increased stability, but do the nature of legged robots, changes in terrain height can 
           cause stability issues. In last is the aerial drone, as some sort of flight controller is neccessary to ensure, it can 
           stably fly/hover in the air.

           <br><br>

           After calculating the scores, it was seen that the best option was the aerial drone. However, in the end the next best choice 
           was taken, due to the lack of any large open areas required for testing or using an aerial drone. As well, I currently lack 
           the skills to pilot a drone, and did not feel it would be appropriate to learn to do so with my own custom drone. This 
           option has been left in the decision matrix for completeness.

        <div class="w-100">
          <h2 class="mb-4 timeline-left-heading">Sourcing Parts</h2>
          <div class="container">
            Before any design work can begin, a few critical parts needed to be sourced. These parts include the servos, battery, 
            microcontroller, and ball bearings. These parts will be bought off the shelf and will be used to dictate the sizing of 
            various components of the robot. While these components may change throughout the design phase, it is a good starting 
            point from which the design can be made. Through the use of parametric design, measurements can be easily changed to fit 
            the new parts, adjusting the design as needed. The parts that were chosen are shown in the picture below, along with an 
            explanation for why these parts were chosen.

            <br><br>
            <img src="./media/SourcedParts.png" style="width: 75%; height: 75%;" class="center">

            In terms of servos, this hexapod will have 3 per leg, for a total of 18. These servos will need to have enough torque to support 
            the robot as well as rotate enough to allow for a wide range of movement. The problem with choosing a servo in the beginning is 
            that you can't know the amount of torque required without knowing the weight and configuration of the hexapod. As such a relatively 
            high torque servo, the <a href="https://www.aliexpress.us/item/32719897757.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.10.7c471802OBIMB9&gatewayAdapt=4itemAdapt" target="_blank"><strong>DS3230</strong></a>, 
            was chosen. This supposedly has 30 kg&#183;cm of torque (at 5v), which should be more than sufficient. Math will be done when a finalized, 
            or semi-finalized design has been completed to ensure that these servos are adequate.

            <br><br>

            Regarding the battery, it should be as compact as possible, and be able to provide at least 18 amps of current. Most servos can pull 
            up to an amp or more when under loaded conditions, leading to this condition. I ended up choosing the 
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071D4J7VV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1" target="_blank"><strong>Zeee 2S Lipo Battery</strong></a> 
            with 7.4V, 80C, and 7200mAh. Based on this rating, it can supply up to 576 amps, which is more than plenty. Unfortunately, the 
            voltage is a little too high for the servos (max of 6.8v) which preferably would be run at 5-6v to ensure high torque, 
            without damaging the servos.

            <br><br>

            The microcontroller and the ball bearings were the easiest to determine. An 
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ELEGOO-ATmega2560-ATMEGA16U2-Projects-Compliant/dp/B01H4ZDYCE?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1" target="_blank"><strong>ELEGOO MEGA 2560</strong></a>, 
            will be used as the microcontroller. The Mega was chosen, as it has more memory, which will be important if inverse 
            kinematic calculations need to be done. As well, it has more i/o ports which is critical, as we need at least 18 for each 
            servo and more, if sensors or transmitters are to be added. The Elegoo variety was chosen over the Arduino, due to the fact 
            that both boards, are equal regarding their specifications but the Elegoo costs half as much as the Arduino. Lastly, the 
            <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Bearings-608-2RS-Skateboard-Bearing-Scooters/dp/B08G487FPL/ref=sr_1_6?th=1" target="_blank"><strong>608RS ball bearings</strong></a> 
            will be used, due to the fact that these are very common and cheap while meeting the required function.

      <!-- SECTION 3: CAD Model -->
      
      <section class="section3 p-3 p-lg-5 d-flex timetime" id="CAD">
        <div class="w-100">
          <h2 class="mb-4 timeline-left-heading">CAD Model</h2>
          <div class="container">
            The CAD model should be designed in such a manner that modify a few variables will cause all the relevent parts to update. 
            In other words, this should be a parametric and a top-down design. A top-down design is usually done at the assembly level, 
            and parts are made such that they reference external dimensions. An advantage with this is that less rework is required when 
            design changes occur. These changes could be things such as changing the length of various limbs or moving a servo. In 
            bottom-up design, you would need to go through each part and rework them to ensure they fit the new changes. In top-down 
            design changing one thing will allow the other parts to update to fit new changes. 
            
            <br><br>

            Normally, this is done within an assembly by creating a layout sketch and having everything reference it. However, when 
            working at the assembly level, it is important to not create circular references or mating conflicts, which can cause 
            unexpected behaviours. As this is a personal project, I've opted to start with a multi-body part instead of an assembly so 
            as to not have to deal with this issue. Upon completion, the various bodies can then be saved individually and then put into 
            an assembly. The layout sketchs for the front and top views are shown below.
            
            <br>

            <img src="./media/LayoutSketchTop.png" class="center">
            <br>

            Using these sketches, each part was created sequentially working from the center outwards. To ensure clarity and to avoid 
            creating unnecessary references, the rollback feature of the feature tree was used to keep all actions (i.e. cuts, extrudes, 
            fillets, etc.) together. A screenshot of the feature tree organized into folders by part is shown below:
