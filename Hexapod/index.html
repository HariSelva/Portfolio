              One of the courses that I most enjoyed during my time at UWaterloo was MTE 544 - Autonomous Mobile Robots. It inspired 
              me to want to build my own mobile robot. Learning more about robotics, ROS, and autonomous navigation is one of the 
              reasons behind this project. In order to do this, I would need a vehicular platform, through which this learning can be 
              done. As well, taking into account, my other interests such as nerf blasters, it would also be interesting to have a 
              mobile nerf turret. As such, this project would need to be a multi-terrain robotic platfrom, on which future projects, 
              whether they be a nerf turret, or an autonomous mobile robot can be built upon.

          <div class="container">
            There were a few design parameters that were set for this project. In no particular order, these are as follows:
            <ul>
              <li>Needs to inherently stable (i.e. it should be able to balance without additional hardware or software)</li>
              <li>Should have at least 3 degrees of freedom to allow for versatility in future projects</li>
              <li>Should be multi-terrain</li>
              <li>Needs to have a platform/area on which additional hardware (i.e. LIDAR, Nerf Turret, Robotic Arm, etc.) can be mounted</li>
              <li>System should be able to support its own weight as well as have capacity for additional hardware</li>
              <li>Parts should be either 3D printed or off the shelf</li>
              <li>Stay within a budget of $400</li>
           </ul>
           The first three parameters defined the type of robot for this project, while the rest ensured it would be successful. Based 
           on these parameters, a hexapod design was decided upon for this robotic platform. A hexapod has the ability to walk 
           using a tripod gait, which allows it to maintain its balance when walking. This ability ensure additional hardware and/or 
           software is unnecessary to keep its balance, which keeps the project from becoming unneccesarily complex.

           <br><br>

           Although a holonomic wheeled robot would also meet the stable and the 3 DOF criteria, a hexapod has the ability to navity a 
           larger variety of terrain. As well, it also has more degrees of freedom. While other legged robots have the same advantages 
           of a hexapod, they require more legs which increases the cost of this project drastically. As the 6 legged hexapod, is the 
           minimum number of legs to ensure an inherently stable robot, this design was chosen for this project.

            Before any design work can begin, a few critical parts need to be sourced. These parts include the servos, battery, 
            microcontroller, and ball bearings. These parts will be bought off the shelf and will be used to dictate the size of the 
            hexapod.

            In terms of servo, this hexapod will have 3 per leg, for a total of 18 servos. These

            Through the use of SolidWorks, an assembly model of the final design concept was created and a motion study was created to 
            visualize the movement of the legs. This is shown in the figure below.

            This solution has achieved most of the goals set out for this project. Some of the next steps are as follows:
            <ol type="1">
              <li>Due to the use of a 4 bar linkage, the legs only have one degree of freedom. This means a lack of variety in the 
                movement, with it only being able to move forwards and backwards. Other mechanisms can be implemented to potentially add 
                more variety to the robot such as turning.</li>
              <li>As there is only a limit degree of freedom, the robot doesn't really need 1 motor per leg. A single motor can be 
                attached via a gear mechanism to control all the legs. This would also serve to eliminate the need for timing on 
                legs.</li>
              <li>Access to the battery and the Arduino is limited when the cover is installed. Additional design features such as a 
                battery cover on the underside can be added to provide easy access without needing to always disassemble the robot.</li>
              <li>Actually 3D print and test the mechanism with the electronics</li>
