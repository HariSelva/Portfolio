              Welcome to my corner of the internet!

              <br><br> 

              I am a University of Waterloo graduate of mechanical engineering with the mechatronics option. My past roles include:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A quality engineer at 
                  <a href="https://nationalmolding.com/locations/nmc-dynaplas-toronto/" target="_blank"><strong>NMC Dynaplas Ltd.</strong></a>,
                  where I improved the QA Inspectors workflow efficiency and accuracy by designing custom fixtures.
                </li>
                <li>
                  An instructor/course developer at <a href="https://www.thesteamproject.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>The STEAM Project</strong></a>, 
                  where I designed and taught unique and captivating DIY STEM/STEAM activity kits to aspiring young scientists and 
                  engineers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A summer academic Ambassador for first year engineering students, as well as a teaching assistant for professional 
                  development (PD) courses at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>UWaterloo</strong></a>, where I 
                  assisted students with their concerns and provided constructive feedback on their assignmments.
                </li>
             </ul>

              I am a problem solver. I love to ideate innovative and out-of-the-box solutions. Being involved in a problem-solving 
              environment, whether it be an escape room or an engineering problem, makes me want to continue learning and keep up with 
              newer technologies. Mechanical engineering and design work is a never-ending passion that I genuinely enjoy engaging in. I 
              enjoy the process of ideation, modelling, and prototyping. Seeing it being used and helping people is such a wonderful 
              feeling! I am into robotics and enjoy learning of new and interesting mechanisms even if they are niche.
              
              <br><br>

              When I am not working, I like reading fantasy/action books, catching up on tv shows, or learning new skills.

              <p class="project-font2">
                Our fourth year design project, LiMar, was to create modular add-on for sports field lining carts which would allow the 
                operator maintain the sport field lines/markings in an easy, consistent and yet affordable manner.
                
                <br><br>
                
                The design made use of 3D printed fixtures designed in SolidWorks, a graphical user interface designed in Python, and a 
                system that made use of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) to provide assistance to the operator.

                An art installation made for an art exhibition that focused specifically on Tech Art. The Puzzle of Secrets aims to 
                highlight how everyone is like a puzzle that needs effort to be solved before learning of their secrets. This could be 
                something as simple as their favourite food or something more complex such as their fears and anxieties. 
                
                <br><br>
                
                The laser cut puzzle is comprised of multiple password locked boxes, which takes advantage of a custom 3D printed 
                locking mechanism to keep the secrets safe. The electronics consisted of an Arduino, LEDs, servo motors, and switches.

                A CAD model concept design of a 3D printable spider quad-robot made using a top-down design approach. It took advantage 
                of a special four-bar linkage called the "Chebyshev lambda linkage" to control the legs.

                <br><br>

                This concept design and the motion studies were all completed in SolidWorks.

              <p class="project-font2">
                Designed and tested a way to improve a pre-existing conveyor system. The original system would be able to identify and 
                sort boxes on the conveyor belts, based on the shapes seen on the boxes. However, this system was limited by the fact 
                that the case of clumped boxes (boxes too close together) would cause inaccuracies. The new system, aimed to detect and 
                divert boxes that were clumped, so as to prevent inaccurate sorting.
                
                <br><br>

                This system was designed and programmed in python using the OpenCV for the image detection, MQTT for the communication 
                between the Jetson Nano and the conveyor PLCs, and Ignition 8 designer for the HMI design.

                A CAD model concept design of a unique system to facilitate a barrel roll designed for the Aquadrone Design Team. This 
                system takes advantage of an asymmetrical weight distribution, which can be rotated to allow for the cylindrical mini 
                sub to complete a barrel roll.

                <br><br>

                This concept design was created in SolidWorks using parts sourced from McMaster Carr. Mathematical calculations were 
                completed to determine the mass and type of motor required for the system to work.
